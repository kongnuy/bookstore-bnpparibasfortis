# BookStore BNP Paribas Fortis

## KATA - DISTRIBUTED DEVELOPER - Online Bookstore

This is a simple code kata that involves creating a basic front-end in React and a back-end using a RESTful API. We will create a Simple Online Bookstore. We will display a list of books and users will have the possibility to add books to their cart, display the cart and modify the quantity of items and remove items from the cart. The system will consist of a React front-end for the user interface and a Java/SpringBoot back-end for handling API requests.
